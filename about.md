Hi and welcome to my site!

I'm a clothing freak that has worked in Fashion (retail, internships, corporate, freelance etc...) for the past several years. I really enjoy making others feel great in what they wear, which is why I created Chic & Flow. I want to make online shopping easier for you, by bringing my favorite pieces from clothing websites into one place.

On almost every item, you'll see why I chose it and often some TIP's on how to style it. If you have any styling questions, want me to feature a new website you love or would just like to chat, e-mail me at
Sogoald@gmail.com
