During the summer I find myself wearing way to many tank tops or basic t-shirts. It’s so hard to come up with great outfits when it’s burning outside, because layering is out of the question. Try to buy more items like this V front cold shoulder top. It's a basic shirt, it’s light, but is SO much cuter than a regular tank.
