I love wearing shorts in the summer, but I don't have the body to wear the high-waisted booty shorts that have been on trend for a while now. Boyfriend shorts are so comfortable, always appropriate and they make your legs look skinny! I'm a fan of boyfriend jeans topped with a flowy cotton top and paired with a simple sandle.
