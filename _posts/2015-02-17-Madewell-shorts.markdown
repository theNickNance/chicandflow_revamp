If you don't own a pair of pointy toed flats, get some. The simple point on the toe will instantly change the look of your outfit from casual to clean-cut. At work, we have a business casual dress code, where many of the women wear heels. I physically can't wear heals every day and felt so out of place when I had to wear flats. Once I discovered the pointy toed flats my problem was solved.

TIP: If you feel like your feet are too flat or wide for these shoes, try going a half size to one size larger.
