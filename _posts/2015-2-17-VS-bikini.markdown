High waisted, anything, has me sold. If your plan is to lye by the pool and get your tan for the week, then this isn’t the bikini for you, it’ll leave an insanely awkward tan line. These high waisted bikini’s are great for pool parties, playing beach volley ball or if you plan on being IN the water all day. Don’t forget, VS sells their bottoms and tops separately, this price is just for the top!
