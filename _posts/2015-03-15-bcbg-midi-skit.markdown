I just recently bought a midi skirt and have yet to wear it--mainly because I haven't had an occasion to wear it to yet. A blog I visit quite often is SeeAnnaJane (http://www.seeannajane.com/) she recently posted an OOTD that featured her blue Zara midi skirt, she paired it with a great leather which shows you how versatile this skirt can be.

TIP: If you want to wear this to work, pair it with a cropped blazer and a pair of close toed heals.
