So, ever since I worked for Corporate America, every time I bought clothes I had to ask myself, "can I wear this to work?" Well, the same thing happened with these Catalina High-Heel's and the answer was YES. There are lots of people out there that think a shoe as eccentric as this isn't appropriate for work, but it all depends on how you style it.

TIP: Wear these Catalina High-Heel's with black or brown pants, or with a knee length dress
