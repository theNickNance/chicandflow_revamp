I am victim to this, and I know you are too--your closet is filled with plaid flannels. How can it not be? They are so easy to throw on top of, quite literally, anything. A really easy way to trick everyone into thinking you aren't just wearing another flannel, is to wear a solid button down such as this Urban Outfitters Button Down. Or, Unbutton this top, slip a white tank underneath and pair it with your favorite jeans.
